 arb_2_desc:0 "The man who rides for pleasure or military occupation has no idea what true horsemanship is. The Bedouin rides to trade, to eat, to live. It should surprise no one that, in addition to the finest horses, Arabia produces the finest cavalrymen."
 arb_3:0 "Bedouin Raiders"
 arb_3_desc:0 "Since before the days of the Prophet, Bedouins have been experts at the art of the raid. An army may march on its stomach, but it won't march far when our raiders take the food right out of the army's mouth through rapid hit and run seizures of their supply lines. Pull back and let the raiders do their work and watch as the invader dies of thirst."
